## Delhi-Metro-Project

This project finds the effective cost and time by choosing the shortest path among different metro lines using the Dijkstra algorithm. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph which in this case represents a network of metro stations

# Contribution that the project is able to make:

It will make things very easy for the new travellers to use the metro and would also help them to know from where to change the station and what path the metro will follow. It would be time efficient. The users would not have to ask others and can use this application to know about the path to follow.
